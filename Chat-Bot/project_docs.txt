Q: What is this platform?
A: This platform is a location-based emergency response system designed for Nepal. It
helps citizens connect instantly with the nearest police station during emergencies using
real-time location detection.

Q: How does the emergency system work?
A: When you press the emergency button, the system captures your GPS location,
identifies the nearest police station, and sends your emergency request directly to that
station along with live location updates.

Q: Do I need to manually select a police station?
A: No. The system automatically finds and contacts the nearest police station based on
your real-time location.

Q: How does the system find the nearest police station?
A: The system uses geographic distance calculations based on latitude and longitude to
identify the closest police station to your current location.

Q: Is my location shared with the police?
A: Yes. During an active emergency, your live location is securely shared with the
assigned police unit so they can reach you quickly.

Q: Can the police track my movement in real time?
A: Yes. Live location updates allow the police to track your movement until the emergency
is resolved.

Q: Is my personal data safe?
A: Yes. All sensitive data is protected using secure authentication methods and is shared
only during emergencies.

Q: What happens after I press the emergency button?
A: Your emergency request is created, assigned to the nearest police station, and the
police receive an instant alert with your live location.

Q: Can I cancel an emergency request?
A: Yes. If the situation is resolved, you can cancel the request or mark it as resolved
through the platform.

Q: Does this system replace emergency phone numbers?
A: No. This system supports emergency services by reducing response time. It does not
replace official emergency phone numbers.

Q: What if my internet connection is weak?
A: A stable internet connection is recommended. In future versions, offline and
SMS-based fallbacks can be added.

Q: Is this platform officially connected to Nepal Police?
A: This is a hackathon prototype designed to demonstrate how emergency response can
be improved. Official integration would require government collaboration.

Q: Can this system be used for ambulances or fire services?
A: Yes. The system is designed to be scalable and can be extended to ambulances and
fire services in the future.

Q: Is the service free to use?
A: Yes. The goal of the platform is public safety and accessibility.

Q: Can I use this system from anywhere in Nepal?
A: Yes. As long as your location is detectable and police station data is available, the
system works nationwide.

Q: Do I need to create an account to use emergency services?
A: Basic information may be required for identification, but the system is designed to be
fast and simple during emergencies.

Q: What information is sent to the police?
A: Only essential details such as your location, emergency status, and basic identification
are shared.

Q: Can I see the police location as well?
A: Yes. In supported views, you can see the responding police unit moving towards your
location.

Q: What should I do if the system fails?
A: If the system is unavailable, immediately use traditional emergency phone numbers.

Q: Is this an AI-based emergency responder?
A: No. The AI assistant only guides users and explains features. All real emergency
actions are handled by police authorities.

Rules:
- The assistant must answer ONLY using this document.
- If the answer is not present, say:
  "Sorry, this information is not available in the app documentation."
